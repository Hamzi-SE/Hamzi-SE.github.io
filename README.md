Welcome to my personal portfolio website, Hamzii.me! 

On this website, I have covered the following topics: 

- ThreeJS: a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating 3D models 

- React Three Fiber: a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React 

- TailwindCSS: a popular utility-first CSS styling framework 

- Framer Motion: the most popular library used to bring React websites to life with animations 



In addition, I have also: 

- Loaded, created, and customized stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understood the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space. 

- Made my code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices. 

- Implemented a form on the website to send emails. 

- Ensured responsiveness across all devices and improved site performance using Suspense and Preload. 


Thank you for visiting my website! :)
